# LanguageGame

## Game mechanics
```
* A word in englich will appear at the top left of your screen, and a stream of spanish translations will start falling.
* your goal is to match the correct translations.
* you gain 1 point for every correct matched
* you lose a 1 point for incorrect matches or ignoring the correct match
* Game ends when you reach 10 points
```

## Though process

```
1- Research and implement game mechanics
time for the task: ~3 hours
things to improve: dont allow player to spam a decision, implement better locking
decision taken in haste: how the game ends, my ideas were after a timespam (like 1 minute) or until there are no more words left.
Ended up implementing that it ends after an specific score (namly 10)

2- Project tests
time for the task: ~1 hours
things to improve: increase game core mechanics test coverage

3-Ui design
time for the task: ~0.5 hours
things to improve: add responsiveness for various screens and orientations

4- file structure, refactor and planing
time for the task: ~1 hours

```
